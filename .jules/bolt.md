## 2024-05-18 - Avoid repeated O(N) string processing in iteration loops
**Learning:** Found an inefficiency in `nebula_writer/audit.py` where long chapter text strings were repeatedly lowercased `chapter_content.lower()` inside a large iteration loop over entities and relationships. This created unnecessary and repetitive overhead for an operation that produces an identical output each time.
**Action:** When performing substring searches against a potentially long block of text across an iteration set, lowercase the text once before entering the loop to ensure O(1) text processing overhead instead of O(N).
## 2024-06-05 - Avoid hidden string allocation overhead in list comprehensions
**Learning:** Python list comprehensions and generator expressions (e.g., `any(c in content.lower() for c in list)`) re-evaluate the target object on every iteration, leading to O(N*M) string allocation overhead if operations like `.lower()` are used.
**Action:** Always pre-compute and cache string transformations into local variables before iterating over them.
## 2024-05-18 - Resolve N+1 query overhead in story auditor
**Learning:** Found an N+1 query issue in `StoryAuditor` where `audit_all_chapters` called `audit_chapter` for every chapter, which in turn queried the database repeatedly for entities, relationships, and events. This caused significant database overhead during full story audits.
**Action:** Always fetch loop-invariant external dependencies outside the loop and pass them in to avoid N+1 queries. Specifically, modified the `audit_chapter` and internal check methods to optionally accept the lists, querying them exactly once in `audit_all_chapters`.
## 2024-05-19 - Add missing indexes to directed graph tables for OR queries
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck in `nebula_writer/codex.py` where querying relationships with `WHERE r.from_entity_id = ? OR r.to_entity_id = ?` was causing a full table scan despite having an index on `from_entity_id`.
**Action:** When working with directed graph tables (like relationships) and querying across both directions using an `OR` condition, always ensure both columns are indexed (e.g., `from_entity_id` and `to_entity_id`). This allows SQLite to utilize the `MULTI-INDEX OR` optimization instead of falling back to a full table scan.

## 2024-06-25 - Maintain cache consistency during iteration
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck in `nebula_writer/outline_engine.py` where `.lower()` was repeatedly called inside generator expressions. While the general solution is to cache list comprehensions (`[t.description.lower() for t in self.open_tensions]`), a functional regression can occur if the original structure is mutated (e.g., adding a new tension) *during* the loop, as the cache will become stale.
**Action:** When pre-computing lowercase strings to avoid O(N*M) allocation overhead in loops, always explicitly `.append()` to the cached list when the original data structure is modified within the iteration to keep the state synchronized.
