## 2024-05-24 - [Remove Hardcoded Supabase Credentials]
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded connection string template (including project ID and hostname) existed in `nebula_writer/postgres_db.py` as a fallback mechanism.
**Learning:** Legacy fallback mechanisms often leak infrastructure details and pose a security risk. They can linger in the codebase if not actively reviewed.
**Prevention:** Strictly enforce the use of environment variables (`POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`) for all database connections and avoid hardcoding any parts of connection URIs, even for fallback purposes.
