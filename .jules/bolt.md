## 2024-05-18 - Avoid repeated O(N) string processing in iteration loops
**Learning:** Found an inefficiency in `nebula_writer/audit.py` where long chapter text strings were repeatedly lowercased `chapter_content.lower()` inside a large iteration loop over entities and relationships. This created unnecessary and repetitive overhead for an operation that produces an identical output each time.
**Action:** When performing substring searches against a potentially long block of text across an iteration set, lowercase the text once before entering the loop to ensure O(1) text processing overhead instead of O(N).
## 2024-06-05 - Avoid hidden string allocation overhead in list comprehensions
**Learning:** Python list comprehensions and generator expressions (e.g., `any(c in content.lower() for c in list)`) re-evaluate the target object on every iteration, leading to O(N*M) string allocation overhead if operations like `.lower()` are used.
**Action:** Always pre-compute and cache string transformations into local variables before iterating over them.
## 2024-05-18 - Resolve N+1 query overhead in story auditor
**Learning:** Found an N+1 query issue in `StoryAuditor` where `audit_all_chapters` called `audit_chapter` for every chapter, which in turn queried the database repeatedly for entities, relationships, and events. This caused significant database overhead during full story audits.
**Action:** Always fetch loop-invariant external dependencies outside the loop and pass them in to avoid N+1 queries. Specifically, modified the `audit_chapter` and internal check methods to optionally accept the lists, querying them exactly once in `audit_all_chapters`.
## 2024-05-19 - Add missing indexes to directed graph tables for OR queries
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck in `nebula_writer/codex.py` where querying relationships with `WHERE r.from_entity_id = ? OR r.to_entity_id = ?` was causing a full table scan despite having an index on `from_entity_id`.
**Action:** When working with directed graph tables (like relationships) and querying across both directions using an `OR` condition, always ensure both columns are indexed (e.g., `from_entity_id` and `to_entity_id`). This allows SQLite to utilize the `MULTI-INDEX OR` optimization instead of falling back to a full table scan.

## 2024-06-15 - Synchronize cached string transformations when mutating underlying structures
**Learning:** When applying performance optimizations like caching string transformations (e.g., `s.content.lower()`) outside of a loop to avoid O(N*M) allocation overhead, modifying the underlying structure (e.g., adding a new `planted_seed`) inside the loop can cause the cache to become stale. This leads to duplicate entries because subsequent loop iterations check the stale cache, fail to find the newly added item, and add it again.
**Action:** Always check if the underlying lists or structures are mutated during the iteration. If so, explicitly update the cache within the loop (e.g., `planted_seed_contents_lower.append(new_content.lower())`) to keep it synchronized and prevent functional regressions.
